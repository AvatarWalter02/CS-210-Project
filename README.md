# Sound & Steps: Analyzing the Relationship Between Audio Exposure and Physical Activity Dynamics

## Objective

Investigate the impact of headphone audio exposure (volume) on physical activity and walking dynamics. Explore whether specific exposure patterns correlate with changes in walking performance, energy expenditure, or step count.

---

## Key Questions

1. Does higher audio exposure correlate with changes in walking performance?
2. Are there optimal audio exposure patterns for maintaining steady physical activity and enhancing walking dynamics?

## Data Requirements

### Apple Health Data

The following data is used for this analysis

- Headphone Audio Exposure
- Walking speed
- Active and basal energy burned.
- Daily step totals.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Integration

- Combine headphone audio exposure data with walking metrics and energy burned data.
- Align timestamps to analyze exposure patterns during physical activity.

### 2. Exploratory Analysis

- **Visualize Trends**:
  - Analyze walking performance based on headphone usage.
  - Examine relationships between headphone exposure energy burned, and walking parameters.
- **Correlation Analysis**:
  - Investigate whether different exposure durations or volumes lead to noticeable changes in walking dynamics or energy metrics.

### 3. Model Development

- **Predictive Models**:
  - Build a model to predict walking performance or energy burned using headphone exposure data as features.
- **Threshold Analysis**:
  - Identify thresholds for headphone exposure that might impact walking dynamics or energy expenditure.

### 4. Behavioral Clustering

- **Cluster Analysis**:
  - Cluster users based on headphone usage patterns and their effect on physical activity metrics (e.g., "high exposure, reduced walking steadiness").
- **Cluster Insights**:
  - Extract insights to categorize behaviors and tailor recommendations.

### 5. Insights and Recommendations

- Provide personalized recommendations for headphone usage to optimize walking efficiency and maintain steady physical activity.

## Challenges & Considerations

1. **Exposure Metrics**:
   - Ensure accurate interpretation of audio exposure data (e.g., thresholds for "high" exposure).
2. **Causation vs. Correlation**:
   - Acknowledge that correlations do not imply causation between headphone exposure and activity metrics.
3. **External Variables**:
   - Account for confounding factors (e.g., workout settings, headphone types, environmental influences).
