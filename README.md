# CS-210-Project: Exploring My Listening Habits

This project aims to analyze my personal Spotify data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights about my listening habits. The project utilizes various data science techniques, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and machine learning, to gain a deeper understanding of my music preferences and behavior.

## Key Questions to Address

1. What are my most-played songs, artists, and genres?  
2. How do my listening habits vary across different times of the day or week?  
3. Are there patterns in the audio features of the songs I listen to (e.g., energy, tempo, danceability)?  
4. Can machine learning techniques recommend new songs based on my listening history?

## Proposed Methodology

### Data Collection
Spotify provides users with access to their personal listening data upon request through its [privacy settings](https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy/). Data to be analyzed includes streaming history, playlists, and audio features (e.g., tempo, valence, danceability). Spotify requires 5 days in order to send you via email. If you want more detailed information it can take upto 30 days.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Examine listening frequency by song, artist, and genre.  
2. Identify patterns and trends in listening habits over time.

### Visualization
1. Create interactive charts to present insights.

### Machine Learning
1. Use clustering techniques to group songs by characteristics and identify music preferences.  
2. Build a simple song recommendation model based on audio features.

### Presentation
1. Develop a GitHub repository containing analysis scripts, a README file, and visualizations.  
2. Create a dashboard or video summarizing findings for easy interpretation.
